		- "Voyeur launches automatically on page load": When a page is loaded, Voyeur will automatically perform an analysis and display it.
		-	"Allow users to choose Voyeur settings": When users click 'Reveal', they will be prompted with filtering options to perform their own analysis.
		- "Reveal only one file from each article": OJS offers the feature of uploading different file formats for a single article. This will only analyze one file per article.
